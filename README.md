# Ticket-Maker
Load multiple images into one image with ticket # and street address

I made this for work. We had this ridiculous way of handling our work pictures
where we had to pull up microsoft paint and paste the pictures in then make
one big file. This method dramatically slowed down our work progress when we
had to complete a substantial amout of tickets a day. I used this to help me
complete more tickets and shared it with my coworkers.

Hopes this helps anyone who needs multiple photos in one image.
